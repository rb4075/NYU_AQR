       "  'description': 'Despite predictions throughout the twentieth century that modernization and secularization went hand in hand with an inevitable decline of religion, the so-called “return of religion” in the late twentieth century called this thesis into question. Political and social shifts of the twenty first century have made it even more clear that to understand our world—its past, present, and future—we must understand religion. But what do we mean when we say religion has “returned” and what do we mean by “religion”? Is it a set of practices, a belief system, an ethnicity, or a cultural identity? This course will be based around the complex and ultimately unanswerable question, “what do we study when we study ‘religion’?” The course will include discussion of major world religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—as well as new religious movements, magic, atheism, and religious identifications such as “spiritual but not religious.” We will discuss religious studies as an academic discipline, the history of religion, sociological and anthropological approaches, the psychology of religion, feminist theory, the idea of “lived religion,” topics within popular culture and religion, and recent political characterizations and debates. Readings may include works by Tala Asad, Graham Harvey, William James, Mircea Eliade, J. Z. Smith, Robert Orsi, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Saba Mahmood, Charles Taylor, Russell McCutcheon, Jeffrey Stout,<strong> </strong>and Michael Warner.\\n\\n',\n",

Community building, family well-being, early childhood education, health, juvenile justice reform, service integration and child welfare are featured in readings, discussion, and internships. Through examples such as ethnic-matching placements in foster care, zero-tolerance approaches to drug abuse, or public financing of political campaigns, students come to understand how government, schools, gangs, religious institutions and families can, with varying degrees of explicitness and formality, all make policy. Students at the course conclusion are able to: identify policies within their lives; argue all sides of a policy question; appreciate the importance of qualitative and quantitative evidence; and distinguish implementation from formulation. Readings include Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, The Lost Children of Wilder, by Nina Bernstein; The Oath and the Office; and Not a Crime to Be Poor by Peter Edelman . Students will be helped to connect meetings they attend and the policy concepts taught and discussed in class. The goal is to leave no student unaware of the importance of policy in their own and their community's life.

The course will entail several field trips, including to the 21 West End archaeology exhibit, The River Project wetlab, and the NYC Archaeology Repository. A major portion of the course will be centered around the artifact that each student will choose to examine from the site of 7 Hanover Square, a late-16th century house site once owned by the pirate Captain Kidd and later by Alexander Hamilton. This site contains some of the first water lots granted for landfill extension, by which real estate was created through a remarkable assemblage of materials (coral from ship ballast, glacial boulders, trash, dead animals, etc.). What is the current context of these landfill sites in our post-Sandy city? What is the future of lower Manhattan overall?

We will begin by discussing key theories of performance from antiquity to the present day. We will then consider how the conventions of representation established by classicism relate to forms of experimentation associated with modernism and the avant-garde. Lastly, we will consider the limits of performance as a facet of our everyday lives. Central to our investigation will be to assess the political and aesthetic dimensions of various literary and performance practices.

       "  'description': 'Over and over, we are told that the world we live in is becoming increasingly global. All its parts are connected to one another, and goods, people, culture, and information can move from one place to another, seemingly without barriers. Yet how new is this phenomenon? Scholars have pointed to the middle of the sixteenth century as the moment when the economy became global, and the age of exploration and colonization began to connect many parts of the world to each other in a complex network that included cooperation, piracy, and slavery. This course will explore the emergence of a global consciousness in the early modern period. Our primary questions include: to what extent did people in this century begin to imagine and experience the world globally (that is, as an entity whose regions were interdependent rather than separate)? Does the change in understanding of the world vary by region, by class, ethnicity, gender, or religion? How did globalization influence cultural developments? What influence did global encounters have on European identities—for example on ideas about, and experiences of, gender, sexuality, class religion, and citizenship? Was the global economy seen as cooperative or competitive? To answer these questions, we will consider how the attempts to create, and the struggle to understand, this global world produced new narratives and forms of interdisciplinary thinking. In order to see how the issues surrounding globalization as we understand them today have a long and complex history, we will also study works that put the past in present in conversation with each other. We will investigate a wide variety of primary works, such as travel narratives, plays, poems, early forms of ethnography, films, engravings, and globes, as well as secondary works by literary scholars, anthropologists, and historians of labor, the economy, and science. While the focus is on the “European” and emerging “American” perspective, we will also read several works that challenge the Eurocentric view of globalization that was emerging and still dominates much of contemporary discourse of globalization. \\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': \"By giving us a sense of place, the city we inhabit recreates us. This documentary photography course explores New York City as the ever-changing environment in which we are involved. Embarking on a photographic project of their design, students depict a highly visible urban space (viewed as a world financial, cultural, artistic capital) through their own relationship to it: their ways of interacting, acting, and being moved. Classes prepare students to work on their position as photographers: as they make pictures in the streets of New York, they determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a particular relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color). Exploring the boundaries between public and private space, feeling space and scale with the body (and not only with one's eyes) and creating a personal color palette are strongly encouraged. Students also explore a photographer's power to change audience perception, for example, through large scale installations inciting viewers to inhabit particular vantage points. Though documentary imagery is traditionally considered to establish a transparent relation to 'reality,' this course challenges students to recognize its created character and to recreate the city by influencing with their photographic intervention the ways it is perceived. Classes are highly collaborative, offering technical instruction, critiques of student work, debates on street photography, visual analysis and discussions with invited artists. Open to highly motivated students with or without experience in documentary photography; digital or film cameras welcome. \\n\\n\",\n",

How are images used politically? Is what is “un-seen” as important as what is seen? Students tackle philosophical, ethical, and political questions, and are encouraged to pursue topics of individual interest for assigned papers and projects. We will ground our discussions in relevant theory and debates and will explore multiple visual genres, including the graphic novel form, film, ads, and photography. In examining the politics of visual images, this course places special, extended emphasis on images in the context of war and humanitarian crises. Throughout, we will think about our own roles in contemporary visual culture; we are consumers, participators, and creators of imagery. What does this mean for us when considered through, for example, an ethical or aesthetic or humanitarian lens? Critical literature by Susan Sontag, Susie Linfield, Scott McCloud, and/or Shahidul Alam, among others, will inform our discussions and deepen student writing. Our syllabus also incorporates journalistic accounts and conflict photography, and may include work by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Students will write reaction papers, longer essays, and have the option of a visual project.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'This course uses social analysis, political speeches, and fiction to explore the relation of race-making, nation-building, and story-telling in the case of the United States. Our broadest premise is that collective subjects (nations, peoples, classes, religions, races) are formed and reformed thorugh narratives and collective action. Our specific premise is that \"American\" nationhood has been formed by racial domination and opposition to it, as represented in contesting narratives. Our goal is two-fold: to assess racialized nationalism in its historic and recent iterations, but also to assess how it is contested differently by scholarly treatises, political speeches, and works of literary and cinematic invention. Part one uses social analysis to explore the intersections entwining settler colonialism, chattel slavery, and immigration restriction, in forming American society and an imagined (\"American\") national community. the practice and meaning of democracy has been set by white supremacy in each regard, but democracy has also been enlarged and remade by social movements and counter-narratives that re-conceive the meaning of both race and nation. Part Two thus uses speeches by activists to clarify the debates in the civil rights era about the goals, means and stories that define effective social change. Part Three compares how fictions in literature and film represent the relation of race, nation, and democratic possibility. Authors include James Baldwin, Toni Morrisoon, Colson Whitehead, Claudia Rankine. Theorists include Michael Rogin, Audra Simpson, Mae Ngai, Hortense Spillers, Saidiyah Hartman, Frank Wilderson, Fred Moten. Films include Bamboozled, GET OUT, and Black Panther. \\n\\n',\n",

Interference often appears as stiff, held muscles, poor body habits and interrupted concentration. You will learn somatic or body awareness methods which are vital to the creative process and honor inner wisdom. Performance is viewed in terms of posture, breath, tension/effort, energy/presence, concentration, body behaviors/habits and mind/body integration. You must be prepared to perform a solo piece of your choosing (or a activity to be observed) by the third week of class and work on it throughout the semester. Kinetic Awareness, The Alexander Technique, meditation, visualization and Eastern energy systems are learned and applied to your performance work.

During our first weeks of study we will consider the stories and histories of earlier generations of migrants. We will focus on the groups that represent the majority of afrolatinxs living in the area: afro-Puerto Ricans, afro-Dominicans and afro-Cubans, but will also learn of the city’s afrodescendiente communities from Honduras, Colombia, Perú, Panamá, and Brazil. In the remaining weeks we immerse ourselves in the study of afrolatinx social and cultural life in New York. Music, memoir, dance, food, fashion and religion figure heavily here, and this course has a significant experiential learning component, so be prepared to get out of the classroom and into neighborhood parks, bodegas, botanicas, clubs, cafeterias, museums, art studios, talleres, barbershops and beauty supply stores. Our experiences in these places are designed to remind us that the body is a site for the accumulation and transmission of knowledge--we will rely on all of our senses to conduct research.

In addition to these novels and \\xa0<em>Madwoman</em>\\xa0 itself, we will read selected poetry by Plath, Emily Dickinson, and Audre Lorde; essays on “women artists” by Eliot and Linda Nochlin; and critical responses by by Gayatri Spivak, bell hooks, and Susan Fraiman.

Over seven thousand miles of sewers undergird the five boroughs of New York; centuries of occluded catastrophe dictate the architectural fabric of modern London; and in metropolises around the world the labor of an unacknowledged precariat lets us pass through the urban everyday without reflection. This course looks at how these invisible cities are made visible through literature. We’ll grapple with the pathological, the potential, the evanescent, and even the scatological, as we ask how literature maps on to hidden registers of the built environment. Alongside conventional exercises in essay writing, research, and in-class presentations, students can expect to put theory into practice with assignments involving urban exploration, literary fieldwork, and urban audition. Writing requirements will include formal papers responding to readings; an exploration journal linking texts and experiences; construction of a city itinerary (and corresponding reaction to a classmate’s); and a final research project (which can, with permission, incorporate creative elements). Events at the Morbid Anatomy Museum and excursions with the Atlas Obscura collective may be arranged. Readings may include fiction (Daniel Defoe, China Miéville, Neil Gaiman), film (\\xa0<em>Undercity</em>\\xa0, \\xa0<em>Dark Days</em>\\xa0), photography (Wayne Barrar), sensation journalism (G.W.M. Reynolds, Eugène Sue, and the files of \\xa0<em>The Illustrated Police News</em>\\xa0), literary history (David Pike, W.G.

       "  'description': 'Increasingly comparable global cities are confronting new migration realities. This course will primarily focus on understanding how global cities have changed and adapted to the 2008 financial crisis and the rise of rightwing political movements, particularly Brexit and Trumpism. How has the global “Great Recession” altered international migration flows? How are global populist, nationalist, and xenophobic movements interlinked across urban centers of Europe, Latin America, and Asia? We will engage theories of global migration, global cities, social movements, and socio-political assimilation, while applying broad theoretical frameworks to modern global city realities, particularly the rise of right-wing nationalism and increasing xenophobia and anti-global trade policy and public opinion. Beyond understanding these new global and migration paradigms, we will study immigrants’ newfound migration, assimilation, and labor pathways in and out of their global city destinations. We will focus on the works of scholars of both global cities and migration, including Saskia Sassen, Richard Alba, Nancy Foner, Maurice Crul, and John Mollenkopf.<strong> </strong>Throughout the course, we will use the global cities of New York City, London, Shanghai, Singapore, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires as case studies, but our focus will not be solely on them.',\n",

       "  'description': 'At the birth of this nation, it was assumed by journalists and their readers that journalists were partisans, telling stories from particular points of view. But the growth of the modern newspaper combined with the ideals of science transformed the image, self-image, and practice of journalism, which now claims to worship at the altar of objectivity, to present information or “news” without bias. This ethic has carried over to the contemporary media, despite challenges from critics that include political power brokers that outspokenly seek to marginalize the press. In this course we examine this ideal or promise: is it possible? desirable? To pursue this inquiry we consider challenges to objectivity by figures such as Truman Capote, who linked a “new journalism” to a personal point of view, Robert McChesney, whose corporate media perspective provides a powerful macro analysis of modern journalism, and Jay Rosen, who articulates the postmodern shifts brought on by the Internet that have redefined and realigned the relationship between the journalist and audience. Readings include Walter Lippmann, Tom Wolfe, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, and Ben Bagdikian.\\n\\n',\n",

Today it is touted as “The Renaissance City,” but in what is the present-day optimism rooted? Is it “boosterism” and wishful thinking? Or will Detroit “rise again” through creative experimentation and entrepreneurial innovation? Has its decline been too pronounced and specific for any hope of reversal? As we explore a landscape where issues of race, class and geography are thrown into bas-relief, we will come to a better understanding of the systemic forces at play in 21st century Detroit. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'In Jorge Luis Borges’s 1941 short story, \\xa0<em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em>\\xa0, a character named Ts’ Ui Pen seeks to build a labyrinth in which all men will lose their way. Borges reveals that labyrinth to be a sprawling book in which all moments in time are followed by every possible subsequent moment. Multiple futures and timelines exist as one in this garden of forking paths. Fast forward to today, where we find that Ts’ Ui Pen’s seemingly incomprehensible vision has come to fruition via video games and interactive fiction. Both often eschew linearity and instead offer users the opportunity to drive the story and shape their own narrative experience. In this course, we will first explore the trajectory of interactive fiction, from its early overtures in works by Borges and Italo Calvino, forward through Agusto Boal’s Forum Theatre, early computer text adventures, \\xa0<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>\\xa0 books, non-linear film, and into the various digital interactive fictions of today, such as hypertext literature, adventure games, and visual novels. From there, students will embark on their own adventure through interactive creative writing. The journey will begin with students taking apart and diagraming existing interactive works, and using digital tools to craft and share their own short interactive scenes and dialogs. We will confront the challenges and limitations of writing interactive story and establish some key critical theories governing non-linearity. The course will culminate in students designing and writing a complete short work of interactive fiction in a medium of their choice. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'The concepts of “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” are capacious, including natural resources, man-made artifacts, monuments,\\n\\nfolklore, myth, and tradition. Most importantly, these concepts connect the past, present and future within a coherent narrative. The\\n\\nconstruction of this narrative itself is an ideologically and politically charged process. This is a history and theory based course that explores how and where this process occurs. How does it manifest itself in the spaces of museums, archaeological digs, sacred spaces, and tourist destinations? And how do these sites shape communities or nations? This seminar traces how global imperial projects of preservation and plunder filled the museums of London, Paris, and Rome. We explore how museums become contested sites of postcolonial nation-building, historical reckoning, and as a means of integrating traumatic events into our historical consciousness. Combining insights from history, museum studies, postcolonial studies, and urbanism, we examine how “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” relate to the history of museums. How can museums be understood as political spaces shaped by national, colonial, and postcolonial forces? How do\\n\\ncolonial and postcolonial politics shape the processes of curation and “museumification?” We also visit museums in New York to discuss the\\n\\npower dynamics behind “museumification” in our own city. More informal writing assignments culminate in two formal research projects. The aim of assignments throughout the seminar is to hone critical thinking and writing skills, to disentangle concepts of “heritage,” and to explore\\n\\nhow museums helped build civilizations, empires, and modern-day nations. Readings may include Sir Walter Scott, Pierre Nora, Michel\\n\\nFoucault, Eric Hobsbawm, Benedict Anderson, Susan Crane, Timothy Michell, Tapati Guha-Thakurta, Nezar AlSayyad, and Alexander Stille.\\n\\n',\n",

The aim of this LAB is to produce a set of new ideas, action items, physical improvements, and ultimately, design proposals to enhance the quality of life in our city. The LAB is will focus on the many systems that structure urban life in New York City. Whether we look at familiar systems, such as transportation, food, waste management or other less, evident systems, such as zoning, water, electricity, or telecommunications, the class will take as its challenge an understanding of all these as “designed” systems that can be affected by strategic interventions. While traditional urban design might focus first on streets and buildings and the spaces between them, the limitation of this established pedagogy its failure to address the many interdisciplinary overlaps that occur in designing and occupying a city. The LAB will engage a wide range of formal and analytical assumptions that underpin the development of existing systems, even as we speculate on new propositions to restructure current socio-ecological frameworks. Introductory design, reading, and writing exercises prepare students for an intense focus on a pressing urban problem, resulting in a final all-class design project that will be presented to the public as part of NYCxDESIGN week. Authors may include Ian McHarg (Design with Nature); Kate Ascher (The Works: Anatomy of a City); William McDonough and Michael Braungart (Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things); Geoff Manaugh (The Bldg Blog Book); David Harvey (The Right to the City); Neil Smith (Uneven Development: Nature, Capital, and the Production of Space); among others.\\n\\n',\n",

This course explores the rise and reign of Rome’s most remembered autocrats, Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, analyzing the birth of the Roman empire from both contemporary and current perspectives. How did Caesar disrupt the traditional dynamics of Roman society? How did the rise of Augustus complicate Roman paradigms of power? And what can these ancient autocrats teach us about leadership and authority in the modern world? Together we examine these questions in context, including the notion of the Pax Romana and Pax Americana, considering also the relationship between power, state, and people within various facets of ancient and modern society. We will utilize both primary texts in translation and secondary sources on the reception of Caesarian politics and the ethics of empire. Readings include Vergil, Ovid, Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt, Duncan Kennedy, and Clifford Ando. A series of short writing assignments will prepare students to explore their historical or theoretical interests in a longer research paper. ',\n",

It also represents justice as tied to a state of equilibrium, which can be completely restored. Yet justice itself is very difficult to define, shifting its meanings over time, between cultures and among individuals; can we presume such a balance? Is justice really only an effect of power, the right of the strong to define the terms under which the weak live? How are law and justice connected? While these seem to be questions for political philosophers, they have also been addressed by literary writers. In this course, our focus will be on how literary texts take up these problems at different junctures primarily in the Western tradition. We will also read some jurists and critical theorists on what constitutes justice—and for whom. Readings may include Plato, Aeschylus, Herman Melville, Bertolt Brecht, Richard Wright, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Martha Nussbaum, and Nadine Gordimer.

This course will explore the literary and aesthetic methodologies used to represent traumatic events and historical crises. By focusing on autobiographical and documentary accounts of three types of dramatic experiences in twentieth-century history (privations and displacement during the October Revolution, hunger during the Leningrad Blockade, and mass incarceration during the Holocaust and Stalinist repressions), we will analyze the international intellectual context that their authors engage with and the ways in which their narratives are structured to impart form to chaos. For their research paper, students will be invited to apply concepts derived from historical readings to analyze an approved work of their choice, emblematic of emergency literature (past or contemporary), and its context. Readings may include: René Descartes, Walter Benjamin, Leo Tolstoy, Victor Shklovsky, Lydia Ginzburg, Varlam Shalamov, Giorgio Agamben, Primo Levi, W.G. Sebald, James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coates.

Singer, “Global bioethics seeks to identify key ethical problems faced by the world's six billion inhabitants and envisages solutions that transcend national borders and cultures.” In this course, we examine the emerging field of global bioethics, addressing questions such as: What bioethical concerns do the world’s populations share in common? What are the opportunities and challenges to establishing a common moral framework for addressing bioethical concerns worldwide? Are cultural and geographic variations of ethical concerns and means for addressing them inevitable and perhaps appropriate? We will explore the historical context, principles and practices of bioethics and global health, as well as their interrelationships. Other issues that we will discuss in this seminar include the social determinants of health, human rights, research ethics, HIV/AIDS, ethical issues at the end of life, and emergency/disaster relief. Throughout the course we will utilize case studies to compare and contrast bioethical dilemmas locally, nationally and internationally. Students will learn and apply a stepwise approach for conducting ethical analysis. Class activities will include simulated clinical bioethics committees, research ethics review committees as well as policy analysis and recommendations. Course readings will include scholarly articles and chapters from the medical and social science literature such as public health, political science and philosophy. Additionally, we will read from selected works of fiction that can inform and enrich our discussion of global bioethics including Camus’ \\xa0<em>The Plague</em>\\xa0 and Conrad’s \\xa0<em>The Heart of Darkness</em>\\xa0.\\n\\n\",\n",

What are the contours of Asian American political consciousness and movement? Using the lens of comparative racial formation, this seminar investigates Asian American political participation around contemporary issues such as immigration, multiracial coalitions, affirmative action, data disaggregation, detention and deportation, Islamophobia, intergenerational relations, and gentrification. This course will explore the political developments that gave rise to “Asian America” in the 1960s and probe deeper theoretical questions about the complexities and pluralities of the contemporary Asian American experience. We will also consider the role of American political institutions including the federal, state, and local governments, and how public policies at all levels come to shape the political lives of Asian Americans in the United States. Texts include Claire Jean Kim’s Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City, Karen Ishizuka’s Serve the People: Making Asian America in the Long Sixties, Eric Tang’s Unsettled: Cambodian Refugees in the New York City Hyperghetto, and Monisha Das Gupta’s Unruly Immigrants: Rights, Activism, and Transnational South Asian Politics in the United States.

Students take each of their stories through a number of drafts and revise them in response to (though not necessarily in accord with) questions and comments raised by other members of the workshop. The objective is to learn ways of staying with such challenges as maintaining the story's voice, determining the order of experience, and arriving at an ending that satisfies the design of the story as well as the intentions of the writer.

How do writers bring a personal voice to writing a political essay? And how do reporters balance opinion and research to show the need for change? These questions are considered as you write 1) an essay centered on an issue that you care about, and 2) a report that you write from observation about a social or political movement.

Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing. Independent studies are graded courses, the details of which are formulated by the student and his or her instructor; these specifics are described in the Independent Study proposal and submitted to the Gallatin School for approval. The student and instructor meet regularly throughout the semester to discuss the readings, the research, and the student\\'s work. Credit is determined by the amount of work entailed in the study and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Generally, independent studies, like other courses, are 2 to 4 credits.

We will explore the colonization of the New World by European powers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. And throughout, we will ask how we can better understand the history of identity formation, orientalism, and imperialism in the pre-modern era.

We’ll carefully explore and interrogate traditional ideas of plot, structure, characterization, and dialogue, but we’ll also place special emphasis on the architecture of the sentence itself: all the little syntactical, acoustic and lexical choices that allow certain lines of prose to feel so uncannily clear and jarring and permanent. How do we use words to get at what Virginia Woolf called “the original jar of the object on the nerves?” The course will operate from the premise that one of the best ways to become a better writer is to become a more conscientious, promiscuous and creatively critical reader of other people’s work. In that spirit, we’ll supplement our weekly workshops by reading and discussing exemplary works of fiction from a diverse array of writers including Joy Williams, Cormac McCarthy, Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Denis Johnson, Flannery O' Connor, Jenny Erpenbeck, and Don DeLillo, among others .

What path has it carved out for itself over the past century? And how do we write about it? This advanced writing course will survey the story of American comedy in all its multifarious formats—the sitcom, the film comedy, the stand-up act, the variety show— while also serving as a workshop for cultural criticism that goes deeper than the recap. Utilizing a combination of reading, viewing, live performances, and workshopping, this course will sharpen students’ skills as writers by exposing them to the wide range of American comedy from Charlie Chaplin to “Key & Peele,” with units on African-American comedy, women in comedy, political comedy, and self-aware comedy, among others. In this course, we will wrestle with the complexities of writing about comedy, including, but not limited to, the question of whether being funny about what’s funny is a faux pas or a necessity. Writing assignments will offer students the opportunity to learn about the craft of cultural criticism by attending a stand-up show and writing a review, writing about a work of comedy that makes you uncomfortable, and other prompts.

Scott in his book Two Cheers for Anarchism, “and look at the history of popular movements, revolutions, ordinary politics and the state from that angle, certain insights will appear that are obscured from almost any other angle.” Using an “anarchist squint,” Scott argues, allows us to better understand more clearly informal order, submerged politics, informal regulation of markets and commons, resistance to the state, subversion of legal regimes, and other topics. In can show us, in other words, the ways that people have built order, regulated their lives, and resisted domination in ways outside and against the state. The idea of this seminar is to adopt such an “anarchist squint” and take anarchism as method for students’ varied work. We will spend the term reading scholarship about communities, property, the state, law, and power to test the utility of an “anarchist squint” for our own work.

       "  'description': 'Despite predictions throughout the twentieth century that modernization and secularization went hand in hand with an inevitable decline of religion, the so-called “return of religion” in the late twentieth century called this thesis into question. Political and social shifts of the twenty first century have made it even more clear that to understand our world—its past, present, and future—we must understand religion. But what do we mean when we say religion has “returned” and what do we mean by “religion”? Is it a set of practices, a belief system, an ethnicity, or a cultural identity? This course will be based around the complex and ultimately unanswerable question, “what do we study when we study ‘religion’?” The course will include discussion of major world religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—as well as new religious movements, magic, atheism, and religious identifications such as “spiritual but not religious.” We will discuss religious studies as an academic discipline, the history of religion, sociological and anthropological approaches, the psychology of religion, feminist theory, the idea of “lived religion,” topics within popular culture and religion, and recent political characterizations and debates. Readings may include works by Tala Asad, Graham Harvey, William James, Mircea Eliade, J. Z. Smith, Robert Orsi, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Saba Mahmood, Charles Taylor, Russell McCutcheon, Jeffrey Stout,<strong> </strong>and Michael Warner.\\n\\n',\n",

Community building, family well-being, early childhood education, health, juvenile justice reform, service integration and child welfare are featured in readings, discussion, and internships. Through examples such as ethnic-matching placements in foster care, zero-tolerance approaches to drug abuse, or public financing of political campaigns, students come to understand how government, schools, gangs, religious institutions and families can, with varying degrees of explicitness and formality, all make policy. Students at the course conclusion are able to: identify policies within their lives; argue all sides of a policy question; appreciate the importance of qualitative and quantitative evidence; and distinguish implementation from formulation. Readings include Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, The Lost Children of Wilder, by Nina Bernstein; The Oath and the Office; and Not a Crime to Be Poor by Peter Edelman . Students will be helped to connect meetings they attend and the policy concepts taught and discussed in class. The goal is to leave no student unaware of the importance of policy in their own and their community's life. Policies that are empowering are emphasized, techniques doe oral and written advocacy, persuasion and attitude change are embedded in a final project that rquires using existing skills and talents and learning new ones.

The course will entail several field trips, including to the 21 West End archaeology exhibit, The River Project wetlab, and the NYC Archaeology Repository. A major portion of the course will be centered around the artifact that each student will choose to examine from the site of 7 Hanover Square, a late-16th century house site once owned by the pirate Captain Kidd and later by Alexander Hamilton. This site contains some of the first water lots granted for landfill extension, by which real estate was created through a remarkable assemblage of materials (coral from ship ballast, glacial boulders, trash, dead animals, etc.). What is the current context of these landfill sites in our post-Sandy city? What is the future of lower Manhattan overall?

We will begin by discussing key theories of performance from antiquity to the present day. We will then consider how the conventions of representation established by classicism relate to forms of experimentation associated with modernism and the avant-garde. Lastly, we will consider the limits of performance as a facet of our everyday lives.

       "  'description': 'Over and over, we are told that the world we live in is becoming increasingly global. All its parts are connected to one another, and goods, people, culture, and information can move from one place to another, seemingly without barriers. Yet how new is this phenomenon? Scholars have pointed to the middle of the sixteenth century as the moment when the economy became global, and the age of exploration and colonization began to connect many parts of the world to each other in a complex network that included cooperation, piracy, and slavery. This course will explore the emergence of a global consciousness in the early modern period. Our primary questions include: to what extent did people in this century begin to imagine and experience the world globally (that is, as an entity whose regions were interdependent rather than separate)? Does the change in understanding of the world vary by region, by class, ethnicity, gender, or religion? How did globalization influence cultural developments? What influence did global encounters have on European identities—for example on ideas about, and experiences of, gender, sexuality, class religion, and citizenship? Was the global economy seen as cooperative or competitive? To answer these questions, we will consider how the attempts to create, and the struggle to understand, this global world produced new narratives and forms of interdisciplinary thinking. In order to see how the issues surrounding globalization as we understand them today have a long and complex history, we will also study works that put the past in present in conversation with each other. We will investigate a wide variety of primary works, such as travel narratives, plays, poems, early forms of ethnography, films, engravings, and globes, as well as secondary works by literary scholars, anthropologists, and historians of labor, the economy, and science. While the focus is on the “European” and emerging “American” perspective, we will also read several works that challenge the Eurocentric view of globalization that was emerging and still dominates much of contemporary discourse of globalization. \\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': \"By giving us a sense of place, the city we inhabit recreates us. This documentary photography course explores New York City as the ever-changing environment in which we are involved. Embarking on a photographic project of their design, students depict a highly visible urban space (viewed as a world financial, cultural, artistic capital) through their own relationship to it: their ways of interacting, acting, and being moved. Classes prepare students to work on their position as photographers: as they make pictures in the streets of New York, they determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a particular relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color). Exploring the boundaries between public and private space, feeling space and scale with the body (and not only with one's eyes) and creating a personal color palette are strongly encouraged. Students also explore a photographer's power to change audience perception, for example, through large scale installations inciting viewers to inhabit particular vantage points. Though documentary imagery is traditionally considered to establish a transparent relation to 'reality,' this course challenges students to recognize its created character and to recreate the city by influencing with their photographic intervention the ways it is perceived. Classes are highly collaborative, offering technical instruction, critiques of student work, debates on street photography, visual analysis and discussions with invited artists. Open to highly motivated students with or without experience in documentary photography; digital or film cameras welcome. \\n\\n\",\n",

Students tackle philosophical, ethical, and political questions, and are encouraged to pursue topics of individual interest for assigned papers and projects. We will ground our discussions in relevant theory and debates and will explore multiple visual genres, including the graphic novel form, film, ads, and photography. In examining the politics of visual images, this course places special, extended emphasis on images in the context of war and humanitarian crises. Throughout, we will think about our own roles in contemporary visual culture; we are consumers, participators, and creators of imagery. What does this mean for us when considered through, for example, an ethical or aesthetic or humanitarian lens? Critical literature by Susan Sontag, Susie Linfield, Scott McCloud, and/or Shahidul Alam, among others, will inform our discussions and deepen student writing. Our syllabus also incorporates journalistic accounts and conflict photography, and may include work by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Students will write reaction papers, longer essays, and have the option of a visual project.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'This course uses social analysis, political speeches, and fiction to explore the relation of race-making, nation-building, and story-telling in the case of the United States. Our broadest premise is that collective subjects (nations, peoples, classes, religions, races) are formed and reformed thorugh narratives and collective action. Our specific premise is that \"American\" nationhood has been formed by racial domination and opposition to it, as represented in contesting narratives. Our goal is two-fold: to assess racialized nationalism in its historic and recent iterations, but also to assess how it is contested differently by scholarly treatises, political speeches, and works of literary and cinematic invention. Part one uses social analysis to explore the intersections entwining settler colonialism, chattel slavery, and immigration restriction, in forming American society and an imagined (\"American\") national community. the practice and meaning of democracy has been set by white supremacy in each regard, but democracy has also been enlarged and remade by social movements and counter-narratives that re-conceive the meaning of both race and nation. Part Two thus uses speeches by activists to clarify the debates in the civil rights era about the goals, means and stories that define effective social change. Part Three compares how fictions in literature and film represent the relation of race, nation, and democratic possibility. Authors include James Baldwin, Toni Morrisoon, Colson Whitehead, Claudia Rankine. Theorists include Michael Rogin, Audra Simpson, Mae Ngai, Hortense Spillers, Saidiyah Hartman, Frank Wilderson, Fred Moten. Films include Bamboozled, GET OUT, and Black Panther. \\n\\n',\n",

Interference often appears as stiff, held muscles, poor body habits and interrupted concentration. You will learn somatic or body awareness methods which are vital to the creative process and honor inner wisdom. Performance is viewed in terms of posture, breath, tension/effort, energy/presence, concentration, body behaviors/habits and mind/body integration. You must be prepared to perform a solo piece of your choosing (or a activity to be observed) by the third week of class and work on it throughout the semester. Kinetic Awareness, The Alexander Technique, meditation, visualization and Eastern energy systems are learned and applied to your performance work.

During our first weeks of study we will consider the stories and histories of earlier generations of migrants.

In the remaining weeks we immerse ourselves in the study of afrolatinx social and cultural life in New York. Music, memoir, dance, food, fashion and religion figure heavily here, and this course has a significant experiential learning component, so be prepared to get out of the classroom and into neighborhood parks, bodegas, botanicas, clubs, cafeterias, museums, art studios, talleres, barbershops and beauty supply stores. Our experiences in these places are designed to remind us that the body is a site for the accumulation and transmission of knowledge--we will rely on all of our senses to conduct research.

While somewhat privileged in terms or race and class, the protagonists of these books find their artistic and intellectual ambitions shaped and thwarted by the limitations of gender at every turn. And through these characters (or so \\xa0<em>Madwoman</em>\\xa0 argued) the authors expressed their own struggles—as “women”--to find a public voice when few women enjoyed the right to vote, attend university, own property, or sign contracts. In addition to these novels and \\xa0<em>Madwoman</em>\\xa0 itself, we will read selected poetry by Plath, Emily Dickinson, and Audre Lorde; essays on “women artists” by Eliot and Linda Nochlin; and critical responses by by Gayatri Spivak, bell hooks, and Susan Fraiman.

Over seven thousand miles of sewers undergird the five boroughs of New York; centuries of occluded catastrophe dictate the architectural fabric of modern London; and in metropolises around the world the labor of an unacknowledged precariat lets us pass through the urban everyday without reflection. This course looks at how these invisible cities are made visible through literature. We’ll grapple with the pathological, the potential, the evanescent, and even the scatological, as we ask how literature maps on to hidden registers of the built environment. Alongside conventional exercises in essay writing, research, and in-class presentations, students can expect to put theory into practice with assignments involving urban exploration, literary fieldwork, and urban audition. Writing requirements will include formal papers responding to readings; an exploration journal linking texts and experiences; construction of a city itinerary (and corresponding reaction to a classmate’s); and a final research project (which can, with permission, incorporate creative elements). Events at the Morbid Anatomy Museum and excursions with the Atlas Obscura collective may be arranged. Readings may include fiction (Daniel Defoe, China Miéville, Neil Gaiman), film (\\xa0<em>Undercity</em>\\xa0, \\xa0<em>Dark Days</em>\\xa0), photography (Wayne Barrar), sensation journalism (G.W.M.

       "  'description': 'At the birth of this nation, it was assumed by journalists and their readers that journalists were partisans, telling stories from particular points of view. But the growth of the modern newspaper combined with the ideals of science transformed the image, self-image, and practice of journalism, which now claims to worship at the altar of objectivity, to present information or “news” without bias. This ethic has carried over to the contemporary media, despite challenges from critics that include political power brokers that outspokenly seek to marginalize the press. In this course we examine this ideal or promise: is it possible? desirable? To pursue this inquiry we consider challenges to objectivity by figures such as Truman Capote, who linked a “new journalism” to a personal point of view, Robert McChesney, whose corporate media perspective provides a powerful macro analysis of modern journalism, and Jay Rosen, who articulates the postmodern shifts brought on by the Internet that have redefined and realigned the relationship between the journalist and audience. Readings include Walter Lippmann, Tom Wolfe, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, and Ben Bagdikian.\\n\\n',\n",

Today it is touted as “The Renaissance City,” but in what is the present-day optimism rooted? Is it “boosterism” and wishful thinking? Or will Detroit “rise again” through creative experimentation and entrepreneurial innovation? Has its decline been too pronounced and specific for any hope of reversal? As we explore a landscape where issues of race, class and geography are thrown into bas-relief, we will come to a better understanding of the systemic forces at play in 21st century Detroit. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'In Jorge Luis Borges’s 1941 short story, \\xa0<em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em>\\xa0, a character named Ts’ Ui Pen seeks to build a labyrinth in which all men will lose their way. Borges reveals that labyrinth to be a sprawling book in which all moments in time are followed by every possible subsequent moment. Multiple futures and timelines exist as one in this garden of forking paths. Fast forward to today, where we find that Ts’ Ui Pen’s seemingly incomprehensible vision has come to fruition via video games and interactive fiction. Both often eschew linearity and instead offer users the opportunity to drive the story and shape their own narrative experience. In this course, we will first explore the trajectory of interactive fiction, from its early overtures in works by Borges and Italo Calvino, forward through Agusto Boal’s Forum Theatre, early computer text adventures, \\xa0<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>\\xa0 books, non-linear film, and into the various digital interactive fictions of today, such as hypertext literature, adventure games, and visual novels. From there, students will embark on their own adventure through interactive creative writing. The journey will begin with students taking apart and diagraming existing interactive works, and using digital tools to craft and share their own short interactive scenes and dialogs. We will confront the challenges and limitations of writing interactive story and establish some key critical theories governing non-linearity. The course will culminate in students designing and writing a complete short work of interactive fiction in a medium of their choice. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'The concepts of “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” are capacious, including natural resources, man-made artifacts, monuments,\\n\\nfolklore, myth, and tradition. Most importantly, these concepts connect the past, present and future within a coherent narrative. The\\n\\nconstruction of this narrative itself is an ideologically and politically charged process. This is a history and theory based course that explores how and where this process occurs. How does it manifest itself in the spaces of museums, archaeological digs, sacred spaces, and tourist destinations? And how do these sites shape communities or nations? This seminar traces how global imperial projects of preservation and plunder filled the museums of London, Paris, and Rome. We explore how museums become contested sites of postcolonial nation-building, historical reckoning, and as a means of integrating traumatic events into our historical consciousness. Combining insights from history, museum studies, postcolonial studies, and urbanism, we examine how “cultural heritage” and “historic preservation” relate to the history of museums. How can museums be understood as political spaces shaped by national, colonial, and postcolonial forces? How do\\n\\ncolonial and postcolonial politics shape the processes of curation and “museumification?” We also visit museums in New York to discuss the\\n\\npower dynamics behind “museumification” in our own city. More informal writing assignments culminate in two formal research projects. The aim of assignments throughout the seminar is to hone critical thinking and writing skills, to disentangle concepts of “heritage,” and to explore\\n\\nhow museums helped build civilizations, empires, and modern-day nations. Readings may include Sir Walter Scott, Pierre Nora, Michel\\n\\nFoucault, Eric Hobsbawm, Benedict Anderson, Susan Crane, Timothy Michell, Tapati Guha-Thakurta, Nezar AlSayyad, and Alexander Stille.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'Students in the LAB class are asked to immerse themselves into design thinking and research, with the goal of understanding the many interlocking issues that emerge with any urban design proposal. The aim of this LAB is to produce a set of new ideas, action items, physical improvements, and ultimately, design proposals to enhance the quality of life in our city. The LAB is will focus on the many systems that structure urban life in New York City. Whether we look at familiar systems, such as transportation, food, waste management or other less, evident systems, such as zoning, water, electricity, or telecommunications, the class will take as its challenge an understanding of all these as “designed” systems that can be affected by strategic interventions. While traditional urban design might focus first on streets and buildings and the spaces between them, the limitation of this established pedagogy its failure to address the many interdisciplinary overlaps that occur in designing and occupying a city. The LAB will engage a wide range of formal and analytical assumptions that underpin the development of existing systems, even as we speculate on new propositions to restructure current socio-ecological frameworks. Introductory design, reading, and writing exercises prepare students for an intense focus on a pressing urban problem, resulting in a final all-class design project that will be presented to the public as part of NYCxDESIGN week. Authors may include Ian McHarg (Design with Nature); Kate Ascher (The Works: Anatomy of a City); William McDonough and Michael Braungart (Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things); Geoff Manaugh (The Bldg Blog Book); David Harvey (The Right to the City); Neil Smith (Uneven Development: Nature, Capital, and the Production of Space); among others.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'description': 'For ancient Rome, the shift from republic to empire meant the unprecedented centralization of power within a single figure. This course explores the rise and reign of Rome’s most remembered autocrats, Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, analyzing the birth of the Roman empire from both contemporary and current perspectives. How did Caesar disrupt the traditional dynamics of Roman society? How did the rise of Augustus complicate Roman paradigms of power? And what can these ancient autocrats teach us about leadership and authority in the modern world? Together we examine these questions in context, including the notion of the Pax Romana and Pax Americana, considering also the relationship between power, state, and people within various facets of ancient and modern society. We will utilize both primary texts in translation and secondary sources on the reception of Caesarian politics and the ethics of empire. Readings include Vergil, Ovid, Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt, Duncan Kennedy, and Clifford Ando. A series of short writing assignments will prepare students to explore their historical or theoretical interests in a longer research paper. ',\n",

It also represents justice as tied to a state of equilibrium, which can be completely restored. Yet justice itself is very difficult to define, shifting its meanings over time, between cultures and among individuals; can we presume such a balance? Is justice really only an effect of power, the right of the strong to define the terms under which the weak live? How are law and justice connected? While these seem to be questions for political philosophers, they have also been addressed by literary writers. In this course, our focus will be on how literary texts take up these problems at different junctures primarily in the Western tradition. We will also read some jurists and critical theorists on what constitutes justice—and for whom. Readings may include Plato, Aeschylus, Herman Melville, Bertolt Brecht, Richard Wright, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Martha Nussbaum, and Nadine Gordimer.

       "  'description': \"According to the philosopher Peter A. Singer, “Global bioethics seeks to identify key ethical problems faced by the world's six billion inhabitants and envisages solutions that transcend national borders and cultures.” In this course, we examine the emerging field of global bioethics, addressing questions such as: What bioethical concerns do the world’s populations share in common? What are the opportunities and challenges to establishing a common moral framework for addressing bioethical concerns worldwide? Are cultural and geographic variations of ethical concerns and means for addressing them inevitable and perhaps appropriate? We will explore the historical context, principles and practices of bioethics and global health, as well as their interrelationships. Other issues that we will discuss in this seminar include the social determinants of health, human rights, research ethics, HIV/AIDS, ethical issues at the end of life, and emergency/disaster relief. Throughout the course we will utilize case studies to compare and contrast bioethical dilemmas locally, nationally and internationally. Students will learn and apply a stepwise approach for conducting ethical analysis. Class activities will include simulated clinical bioethics committees, research ethics review committees as well as policy analysis and recommendations. Course readings will include scholarly articles and chapters from the medical and social science literature such as public health, political science and philosophy. Additionally, we will read from selected works of fiction that can inform and enrich our discussion of global bioethics including Camus’ \\xa0<em>The Plague</em>\\xa0 and Conrad’s \\xa0<em>The Heart of Darkness</em>\\xa0.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'description': 'What does the growing population of Asian Americans mean for the landscape of American politics? What are the contours of Asian American political consciousness and movement? Using the lens of comparative racial formation, this seminar investigates Asian American political participation around contemporary issues such as immigration, multiracial coalitions, affirmative action, data disaggregation, detention and deportation, Islamophobia, intergenerational relations, and gentrification. This course will explore the political developments that gave rise to “Asian America” in the 1960s and probe deeper theoretical questions about the complexities and pluralities of the contemporary Asian American experience. We will also consider the role of American political institutions including the federal, state, and local governments, and how public policies at all levels come to shape the political lives of Asian Americans in the United States. Texts include Claire Jean Kim’s Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City, Karen Ishizuka’s Serve the People: Making Asian America in the Long Sixties, Eric Tang’s Unsettled: Cambodian Refugees in the New York City Hyperghetto, and Monisha Das Gupta’s Unruly Immigrants: Rights, Activism, and Transnational South Asian Politics in the United States. As we read these texts, students will be exposed to intersectional, comparative, and emergent approaches to the study of race, culture, power, place, and politics. \\n\\n',\n",

Each writer focuses their efforts on only one or two short stories, rather than starting many new stories and abandoning them in favor of yet another new beginning. Students take each of their stories through a number of drafts and revise them in response to (though not necessarily in accord with) questions and comments raised by other members of the workshop. The objective is to learn ways of staying with such challenges as maintaining the story's voice, determining the order of experience, and arriving at an ending that satisfies the design of the story as well as the intentions of the writer. Workshop members share their stories in class throughout the semester and comment in detail on one another's work. Participants should have some experience writing short stories. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

How do writers bring a personal voice to writing a political essay? And how do reporters balance opinion and research to show the need for change? These questions are considered as you write 1) an essay centered on an issue that you care about, and 2) a report that you write from observation about a social or political movement. Finally, writing an argument or advocacy piece on a public debate allows you to incorporate many of the lessons from the semester.

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the professor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing. Independent studies are graded courses, the details of which are formulated by the student and his or her instructor; these specifics are described in the Independent Study proposal and submitted to the Gallatin School for approval. The student and instructor meet regularly throughout the semester to discuss the readings, the research, and the student\\'s work. Credit is determined by the amount of work entailed in the study and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Generally, independent studies, like other courses, are 2 to 4 credits.

In this course, we will investigate the ways in which the Middle Ages were actually a period of vast movement, migration, and pilgrimage. We will study the “discovery” of North America by Scandinavian sailors five centuries before Columbus. We will explore the colonization of the New World by European powers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. And throughout, we will ask how we can better understand the history of identity formation, orientalism, and imperialism in the pre-modern era. We will delve into the questions, the conflicts, and the painful changes that these travels and encounters fomented both within European society and without.

       "  'description': \"“Good writing,” Joy Williams argues, “startles the reader back into Life.” Keeping that core criterion in mind, this introductory workshop course will ask students to steep themselves in the immersive disciplines of writing and critiquing original works of fiction. We’ll carefully explore and interrogate traditional ideas of plot, structure, characterization, and dialogue, but we’ll also place special emphasis on the architecture of the sentence itself: all the little syntactical, acoustic and lexical choices that allow certain lines of prose to feel so uncannily clear and jarring and permanent. How do we use words to get at what Virginia Woolf called “the original jar of the object on the nerves?” The course will operate from the premise that one of the best ways to become a better writer is to become a more conscientious, promiscuous and creatively critical reader of other people’s work. In that spirit, we’ll supplement our weekly workshops by reading and discussing exemplary works of fiction from a diverse array of writers including Joy Williams, Cormac McCarthy, Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Denis Johnson, Flannery O' Connor, Jenny Erpenbeck, and Don DeLillo, among others . Students will also be given short writing prompts that allow them to experiment with the formal strategies they encounter in those texts.\\n\\n\",\n",

Utilizing a combination of reading, viewing, live performances, and workshopping, this course will sharpen students’ skills as writers by exposing them to the wide range of American comedy from Charlie Chaplin to “Key & Peele,” with units on African-American comedy, women in comedy, political comedy, and self-aware comedy, among others. In this course, we will wrestle with the complexities of writing about comedy, including, but not limited to, the question of whether being funny about what’s funny is a faux pas or a necessity. Writing assignments will offer students the opportunity to learn about the craft of cultural criticism by attending a stand-up show and writing a review, writing about a work of comedy that makes you uncomfortable, and other prompts.

Scott in his book Two Cheers for Anarchism, “and look at the history of popular movements, revolutions, ordinary politics and the state from that angle, certain insights will appear that are obscured from almost any other angle.” Using an “anarchist squint,” Scott argues, allows us to better understand more clearly informal order, submerged politics, informal regulation of markets and commons, resistance to the state, subversion of legal regimes, and other topics. In can show us, in other words, the ways that people have built order, regulated their lives, and resisted domination in ways outside and against the state. The idea of this seminar is to adopt such an “anarchist squint” and take anarchism as method for students’ varied work. We will spend the term reading scholarship about communities, property, the state, law, and power to test the utility of an “anarchist squint” for our own work.

      "This interdisciplinary seminar will provide an intensive introduction to the study of mass media. Utilizing wide ranging critical and theoretical methodologies, the course will consider how media alternately reflects and forms our sense of politics, economics, race, gender, sexuality and citizenship. The course will be concerned with questions such as: What function does mass media serve for society? How does a media saturated cultural environment shape our identity? How do mass media forms delineate and naturalize prevailing ideologies and ways of being in the world? Can media provide a means to challenge cultural and political hegemony? Readings will be drawn from Berger’s  <em>Media Analysis Techniques</em>  as well as the anthologies  <em>The Media Studies Reader</em>  and  <em>Gender, Race and Class in the Media</em>  and the course will include excerpts from the films  <em>The Dark Knight Rises, The Secret, The Truman Show, The Bling Ring, Network</em> , and  <em>Idiocracy</em> , television shows  <em>Ways of Seeing</em> ,  <em>The Daily Show</em> ,  <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> ,  <em>The Simpsons,</em>   <em>South Park </em> and  <em>The X-Files</em> , as well as a selection of\n",

      "Despite predictions throughout the twentieth century that modernization and secularization went hand in hand with an inevitable decline of religion, the so-called “return of religion” in the late twentieth century called this thesis into question. Political and social shifts of the twenty first century have made it even more clear that to understand our world—its past, present, and future—we must understand religion. But what do we mean when we say religion has “returned” and what do we mean by “religion”? Is it a set of practices, a belief system, an ethnicity, or a cultural identity? This course will be based around the complex and ultimately unanswerable question, “what do we study when we study ‘religion’?” The course will include discussion of major world religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—as well as new religious movements, magic, atheism, and religious identifications such as “spiritual but not religious.” We will discuss religious studies as an academic discipline, the history of religion, sociological and anthropological approaches, the psychology of religion, feminist theory, the idea of “lived religion,” topics within popular culture and religion, and recent political characterizations and debates. Readings may include works by Tala Asad, Graham Harvey, William James, Mircea Eliade, J. Z. Smith, Robert Orsi, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Saba Mahmood, Charles Taylor, Russell McCutcheon, Jeffrey Stout,<strong> </strong>and Michael Warner.\n",

      "This course covers the very basic techniques of photography and digital imaging. Beyond Picture Perfect explores the many choices available to today’s image makers. New technology combined with traditional photographic techniques will be addressed, enabling the students to realize their distinctive image-making vocabulary. Daily discussions include understanding hardware mechanics, choosing a personal color palette, and recognizing “your” unique composition key. We will debate the many analog and digital tools available to photographers vital to their artistic expression. These concepts will be supported by daily assignments and class critiques culminating in a final project portfolio. Students with interest in analog or digital formats will be encouraged to develop an understanding of their medium and form an original visual strategy. Museum/ gallery visits and field trips for on-location photographing will inspire students to create their own way of seeing. Readings may include selections from: Robert Adams,  <em>Why People Photograph</em> ; London and Upton,  <em>Photography</em> .\n",

For philosophers, Classicists and political theorists, Plato’s  <em>Republic</em>  incites readings, re-readings, debate and controversy: is Plato the greatest political idealist? The first totalitarian? Is Plato a feminist? In this course, we will analyze the dialogue’s arguments, analogies and imagery and interrogate Platonic metaphysics, aesthetics and theory of politics as they are presented in the dialogue. Supplemental readings will include modern and contemporary interpretations and will address: intellectual milieu, historical and political context, questions of genre. \n",
      "This workshop studies the current forms and genres of television storytelling by analyzing the creative process through which an original series makes its way to the screen. Together, we will look at early proposals developed by the original show creators to present the narratives arcs and character profiles of their series, and we will compare them to the full pilot episodes. The in-class screenings will include  <em>True Detective</em> ,  <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> ,  <em>Black Mirror</em> ,  <em>New Girl</em> ,  <em>Fargo</em> ,  <em>Breaking Bad</em> ,  <em>Mr. Robot</em> , and  <em>Stranger Things</em> . This analysis will serve as a foundation for the creation of the participants’ unique series proposals, which include the pitching of a pilot episode, the development of a first season outline, and the establishment of the series’ visual and narrative tone.\n",
      "Intended to introduce policy, this course includes an internship at a policy and/or advocacy organization. Community building, family well-being, early childhood education, health, juvenile justice reform, service integration and child welfare are featured in readings, discussion, and internships. Through examples such as ethnic-matching placements in foster care, zero-tolerance approaches to drug abuse, or public financing of political campaigns, students come to understand how government, schools, gangs, religious institutions and families can, with varying degrees of explicitness and formality, all make policy. Students at the course conclusion are able to: identify policies within their lives; argue all sides of a policy question; appreciate the importance of qualitative and quantitative evidence; and distinguish implementation from formulation. Readings include Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, The Lost Children of Wilder, by Nina Bernstein; The Oath and the Office; and Not a Crime to Be Poor by Peter Edelman . Students will be helped to connect meetings they attend and the policy concepts taught and discussed in class. The goal is to leave no student unaware of the importance of policy in their own and their community's life. Policies that are empowering are emphasized, techniques doe oral and written advocacy, persuasion and attitude change are embedded in a final project that rquires using existing skills and talents and learning new ones. Assignments include an internship journal. Films include Ethics in America and Waiting for Superman.\n",

      "This course entwines archaeology, geomorphology, climate change considerations, and science fiction to think about the changing coastlines of New York City and the impact of urbanism on the natural environment. We will examine the past, present, and future of our waterways and become familiar with the range of marine biology projects currently in place in the New York harbor area. The course will entail several field trips, including to the 21 West End archaeology exhibit, The River Project wetlab, and the NYC Archaeology Repository. A major portion of the course will be centered around the artifact that each student will choose to examine from the site of 7 Hanover Square, a late-16th century house site once owned by the pirate Captain Kidd and later by Alexander Hamilton. This site contains some of the first water lots granted for landfill extension, by which real estate was created through a remarkable assemblage of materials (coral from ship ballast, glacial boulders, trash, dead animals, etc.). What is the current context of these landfill sites in our post-Sandy city? What is the future of lower Manhattan overall? In addition to scientific publications, we will draw from historic representations such as  <em>The Big Oyster </em> by Mark Kurlansky, the futuristic imaginations of Kim Stanley Robinson’s  <em>NY </em>  <em>2140</em>  <em>,</em>  and contemporary efforts such as the Billion Oyster Project to regenerate the waterways in order to envision the relationship between the historical, contemporary, and future material culture and coastlines of New York City.\n",
      "In this class we will consider the relations between literature and the performing arts. What is the relationship between text and performance? How can we approach theatre, dance and music through the lenses of literature and philosophy? And how might theatre, dance, and music deepen and enrich our understanding of literary and philosophical texts? We will begin by discussing key theories of performance from antiquity to the present day. We will then consider how the conventions of representation established by classicism relate to forms of experimentation associated with modernism and the avant-garde. Lastly, we will consider the limits of performance as a facet of our everyday lives. Central to our investigation will be to assess the political and aesthetic dimensions of various literary and performance practices. Students will use these materials to hone and develop their research skills and formulate final projects that bring course topics into conversation with their individual academic interests. In addition to the dedicated reading of course materials, students will take advantage of performance events around NYC. This is an active learning course and full participation is required.\n",

      "Over and over, we are told that the world we live in is becoming increasingly global. All its parts are connected to one another, and goods, people, culture, and information can move from one place to another, seemingly without barriers. Yet how new is this phenomenon? Scholars have pointed to the middle of the sixteenth century as the moment when the economy became global, and the age of exploration and colonization began to connect many parts of the world to each other in a complex network that included cooperation, piracy, and slavery. This course will explore the emergence of a global consciousness in the early modern period. Our primary questions include: to what extent did people in this century begin to imagine and experience the world globally (that is, as an entity whose regions were interdependent rather than separate)? Does the change in understanding of the world vary by region, by class, ethnicity, gender, or religion? How did globalization influence cultural developments? What influence did global encounters have on European identities—for example on ideas about, and experiences of, gender, sexuality, class religion, and citizenship? Was the global economy seen as cooperative or competitive? To answer these questions, we will consider how the attempts to create, and the struggle to understand, this global world produced new narratives and forms of interdisciplinary thinking. In order to see how the issues surrounding globalization as we understand them today have a long and complex history, we will also study works that put the past in present in conversation with each other. We will investigate a wide variety of primary works, such as travel narratives, plays, poems, early forms of ethnography, films, engravings, and globes, as well as secondary works by literary scholars, anthropologists, and historians of labor, the economy, and science. While the focus is on the “European” and emerging “American” perspective, we will also read several works that challenge the Eurocentric view of globalization that was emerging and still dominates much of contemporary discourse of globalization. \n",

      "By giving us a sense of place, the city we inhabit recreates us. This documentary photography course explores New York City as the ever-changing environment in which we are involved. Embarking on a photographic project of their design, students depict a highly visible urban space (viewed as a world financial, cultural, artistic capital) through their own relationship to it: their ways of interacting, acting, and being moved. Classes prepare students to work on their position as photographers: as they make pictures in the streets of New York, they determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a particular relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color). Exploring the boundaries between public and private space, feeling space and scale with the body (and not only with one's eyes) and creating a personal color palette are strongly encouraged. Students also explore a photographer's power to change audience perception, for example, through large scale installations inciting viewers to inhabit particular vantage points. Though documentary imagery is traditionally considered to establish a transparent relation to 'reality,' this course challenges students to recognize its created character and to recreate the city by influencing with their photographic intervention the ways it is perceived. Classes are highly collaborative, offering technical instruction, critiques of student work, debates on street photography, visual analysis and discussions with invited artists. Open to highly motivated students with or without experience in documentary photography; digital or film cameras welcome. \n",

      "The most ambitious of the postwar American journalism to appear in magazines like  <em>The New Yorker, Harper’s, Esquire </em> and  <em>The New York Review of Books </em> gave rise to a new and distinctly indigenous documentary literature, with its own possibilities and poetics. In this class we explore how this body of work redrew the formal boundaries of longform reporting, the profile, the essay, personal history and cultural criticism. We consider the emergence of the narrator as a character, the uses of rhetoric, approaches to the sentence, tone, rhythm, and structure, as well as questions of veracity and credibility. Students try their hand at these forms while responding to readings that include James Baldwin, Ian Frazier, Joseph Mitchell, Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, Donald Antrim, Janet Malcolm, Alma Guillermoprieto, George W.S.

      "Due to recent political events stemming from the rise of populism across the globe, dystopian literature from George Orwell’s  <em>1984</em>  to Margaret Atwood’s  <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>  have been flying off the shelves. But what about the utopian literature on which they are based? This research seminar traces the path from ancient to contemporary utopias to explore these paradise spaces and the dystopic elements within them. How do we define a utopia? What can utopian literature tell us about time and place? How ideal are these “ideal” spaces, particularly if a utopia is marked by exclusion? How are legacies of empire treated in utopian literature? How can we analyze utopias through the lenses of history, feminism, queer theory, or the place of race, religion, or personal identity? Readings may include selections from Plato's  <em>Republic</em> , Virgil’s  <em>Eclogues,</em>  Christine de Pizan's  <em>Book of the City of Ladies</em> , Thomas More's  <em>Utopia, </em> and John Milton’s  <em>Paradise Lost</em> ; as well as Shakespeare's  <em>As You Like It</em> , Aldous Huxley’s  <em>Brave New World </em> (yes, as a utopia!), Ursula K. Le Guin’s “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,” and Jez Butterworth's  <em>Jerusalem</em> . We will close by exploring how utopian ideas are represented on stage and screen with the film  <em>Wall-E</em>  and a trip to the NYPL for the Performing Arts to watch the 2011 Broadway production of  <em>Jerusalem</em> .\n",

      "In this course students learn to think about the reading and writing practices of contemporary visual culture. What does it mean to “read” an image? How are images used politically? Is what is “un-seen” as important as what is seen? Students tackle philosophical, ethical, and political questions, and are encouraged to pursue topics of individual interest for assigned papers and projects. We will ground our discussions in relevant theory and debates and will explore multiple visual genres, including the graphic novel form, film, ads, and photography. In examining the politics of visual images, this course places special, extended emphasis on images in the context of war and humanitarian crises. Throughout, we will think about our own roles in contemporary visual culture; we are consumers, participators, and creators of imagery. What does this mean for us when considered through, for example, an ethical or aesthetic or humanitarian lens? Critical literature by Susan Sontag, Susie Linfield, Scott McCloud, and/or Shahidul Alam, among others, will inform our discussions and deepen student writing. Our syllabus also incorporates journalistic accounts and conflict photography, and may include work by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Students will write reaction papers, longer essays, and have the option of a visual project.\n",

      "This course uses social analysis, political speeches, and fiction to explore the relation of race-making, nation-building, and story-telling in the case of the United States. Our broadest premise is that collective subjects (nations, peoples, classes, religions, races) are formed and reformed thorugh narratives and collective action. Our specific premise is that \"American\" nationhood has been formed by racial domination and opposition to it, as represented in contesting narratives. Our goal is two-fold: to assess racialized nationalism in its historic and recent iterations, but also to assess how it is contested differently by scholarly treatises, political speeches, and works of literary and cinematic invention. Part one uses social analysis to explore the intersections entwining settler colonialism, chattel slavery, and immigration restriction, in forming American society and an imagined (\"American\") national community. the practice and meaning of democracy has been set by white supremacy in each regard, but democracy has also been enlarged and remade by social movements and counter-narratives that re-conceive the meaning of both race and nation. Part Two thus uses speeches by activists to clarify the debates in the civil rights era about the goals, means and stories that define effective social change. Part Three compares how fictions in literature and film represent the relation of race, nation, and democratic possibility. Authors include James Baldwin, Toni Morrisoon, Colson Whitehead, Claudia Rankine. Theorists include Michael Rogin, Audra Simpson, Mae Ngai, Hortense Spillers, Saidiyah Hartman, Frank Wilderson, Fred Moten. Films include Bamboozled, GET OUT, and Black Panther. \n",

      "Body awareness, by listening to the body's communication with mindful attention, increases one's ability to strip away any physical and mental interference which can impair performance. Interference often appears as stiff, held muscles, poor body habits and interrupted concentration. You will learn somatic or body awareness methods which are vital to the creative process and honor inner wisdom. Performance is viewed in terms of posture, breath, tension/effort, energy/presence, concentration, body behaviors/habits and mind/body integration. You must be prepared to perform a solo piece of your choosing (or a activity to be observed) by the third week of class and work on it throughout the semester. Kinetic Awareness, The Alexander Technique, meditation, visualization and Eastern energy systems are learned and applied to your performance work. Open to performing arts students who wish to deepen their relationship to their bodies and draw on inner reserves.

This course follows the varied social imageries of “madness” throughout Western history, from the Bible to the contemporary and controversial Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) in its most recent 5th edition. Students will read primary and secondary texts by philosophers, physicians, theologians, jurists, tragedians, novelists, psychologists, social reformers, policy makers, journalists, historians and individuals who suffered madness. They will also watch art and films that portray the phenomenon of madness. Reading includes: the Bible, Plato, Hippocrates, Ibn Sina, Margery Kempe, Robert Burton, Sigmund Freud, George Canguilhem, Michel Foucault, Ian Hacking, Elaine Showalter, Ruth Leys among others.

Each student will take on multiple roles in each phase of the production. The course will be broken up into three parts. The first section begins with a brainstorming session in which the themes and storylines of the movie are conceived. The script is then written, scenes workshopped and the group prepares to shoot. The second section is the shoot, with roles divided between camera, direction, acting, producing, art direction, and the rest. The final section is the edit and post-production.

While somewhat privileged in terms or race and class, the protagonists of these books find their artistic and intellectual ambitions shaped and thwarted by the limitations of gender at every turn. And through these characters (or so  <em>Madwoman</em>  argued) the authors expressed their own struggles—as “women”--to find a public voice when few women enjoyed the right to vote, attend university, own property, or sign contracts. In addition to these novels and  <em>Madwoman</em>  itself, we will read selected poetry by Plath, Emily Dickinson, and Audre Lorde; essays on “women artists” by Eliot and Linda Nochlin; and critical responses by by Gayatri Spivak, bell hooks, and Susan Fraiman. \n",

      "Tutorials are small groups of two to five students working closely with a faculty member on a common topic, project, or skill. Tutorials are usually student-generated projects and like independent studies, ideas for tutorials typically follow from questions raised in a particular course. Students may collaborate on creative projects as well, and some titles of recent tutorials include \"Writing Long Fiction,\" \"Dante's Literary and Historical Background,\" and \"Environmental Design.\" Tutorials are graded courses, and students work together with the instructor to formulate the structure of the tutorial, the details of which are described in the tutorial proposal and submitted to the Gallatin School for approval. The tutorial group meets regularly throughout the semester, and students follow a common syllabus: all participants complete the same readings, write papers on similar topics, etc. Students in the same tutorial must register for the same number of credits. Credit is determined by the amount of work (readings and other types of assignments) and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Tutorials range from 2 to 4 credits. Meeting hours correspond to course credits: a 4-credit tutorial requires at least fourteen contact hours per term between the teacher and students.\n",

Participants develop a solo performance through a series of exercises using memory, movement and written and visual imagery, and explore the associative strategies of collage and pastiche as methodologies for structuring material. The solos emerge from a process involving improvisation (movement and text), composing, and revision of material. Readings include performance texts by prominent artists, essays on performance, and video viewings, which foreground the tendency in performance to explore subjectivity and identity in light of social and political critique. Required texts include Jo Bonney’s  <em>Extreme Exposure</em> , C. Carr's  <em>On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century</em> , and Lenora Champagne’s  <em>Out from Under: Texts by Women Performance Artists</em> . Additional readings include Colin Counsell, \"Postmodernism and Performance Art,\" Roselee Goldberg, \"Performance: A Hidden History,\" Jonathan Kalb, \"Documentary Solo Performance: The Politics of the Mirrored Self,\" and an essay by Coco Fusco. Assignments include a solo performance created from the material developed in class (rather than \"polishing\" an already created piece), along with a written analysis of two live solo performances, and an oral presentation.

Over seven thousand miles of sewers undergird the five boroughs of New York; centuries of occluded catastrophe dictate the architectural fabric of modern London; and in metropolises around the world the labor of an unacknowledged precariat lets us pass through the urban everyday without reflection. This course looks at how these invisible cities are made visible through literature. We’ll grapple with the pathological, the potential, the evanescent, and even the scatological, as we ask how literature maps on to hidden registers of the built environment. Alongside conventional exercises in essay writing, research, and in-class presentations, students can expect to put theory into practice with assignments involving urban exploration, literary fieldwork, and urban audition. Writing requirements will include formal papers responding to readings; an exploration journal linking texts and experiences; construction of a city itinerary (and corresponding reaction to a classmate’s); and a final research project (which can, with permission, incorporate creative elements). Events at the Morbid Anatomy Museum and excursions with the Atlas Obscura collective may be arranged.

      "Increasingly comparable global cities are confronting new migration realities. This course will primarily focus on understanding how global cities have changed and adapted to the 2008 financial crisis and the rise of rightwing political movements, particularly Brexit and Trumpism. How has the global “Great Recession” altered international migration flows? How are global populist, nationalist, and xenophobic movements interlinked across urban centers of Europe, Latin America, and Asia? We will engage theories of global migration, global cities, social movements, and socio-political assimilation, while applying broad theoretical frameworks to modern global city realities, particularly the rise of right-wing nationalism and increasing xenophobia and anti-global trade policy and public opinion. Beyond understanding these new global and migration paradigms, we will study immigrants’ newfound migration, assimilation, and labor pathways in and out of their global city destinations. We will focus on the works of scholars of both global cities and migration, including Saskia Sassen, Richard Alba, Nancy Foner, Maurice Crul, and John Mollenkopf.<strong> </strong>Throughout the course, we will use the global cities of New York City, London, Shanghai, Singapore, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires as case studies, but our focus will not be solely on them.\n",
      "At the birth of this nation, it was assumed by journalists and their readers that journalists were partisans, telling stories from particular points of view. But the growth of the modern newspaper combined with the ideals of science transformed the image, self-image, and practice of journalism, which now claims to worship at the altar of objectivity, to present information or “news” without bias. This ethic has carried over to the contemporary media, despite challenges from critics that include political power brokers that outspokenly seek to marginalize the press. In this course we examine this ideal or promise: is it possible? desirable? To pursue this inquiry we consider challenges to objectivity by figures such as Truman Capote, who linked a “new journalism” to a personal point of view, Robert McChesney, whose corporate media perspective provides a powerful macro analysis of modern journalism, and Jay Rosen, who articulates the postmodern shifts brought on by the Internet that have redefined and realigned the relationship between the journalist and audience. Readings include Walter Lippmann, Tom Wolfe, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, and Ben Bagdikian.\n",

      "This course examines the ways in which Detroit has been imagined, represented and parsed in literature, documentary film, political discourse and historical narratives: first as the “Stove Capital” (1850s), as a “Coach and Carriage” center (1890s), as the “Motor City” in the early decades of the 20th century, as the “Arsenal of Democracy” during World War II, as “Motown” in the postwar period, as “The Murder Capital” in the 1970s, and as a “Third World” city on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1980s and 1990s. Today it is touted as “The Renaissance City,” but in what is the present-day optimism rooted? Is it “boosterism” and wishful thinking? Or will Detroit “rise again” through creative experimentation and entrepreneurial innovation? Has its decline been too pronounced and specific for any hope of reversal? As we explore a landscape where issues of race, class and geography are thrown into bas-relief, we will come to a better understanding of the systemic forces at play in 21st century Detroit. \n",
      "In Jorge Luis Borges’s 1941 short story,  <em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em> , a character named Ts’ Ui Pen seeks to build a labyrinth in which all men will lose their way. Borges reveals that labyrinth to be a sprawling book in which all moments in time are followed by every possible subsequent moment. Multiple futures and timelines exist as one in this garden of forking paths. Fast forward to today, where we find that Ts’ Ui Pen’s seemingly incomprehensible vision has come to fruition via video games and interactive fiction. Both often eschew linearity and instead offer users the opportunity to drive the story and shape their own narrative experience. In this course, we will first explore the trajectory of interactive fiction, from its early overtures in works by Borges and Italo Calvino, forward through Agusto Boal’s Forum Theatre, early computer text adventures,  <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>  books, non-linear film, and into the various digital interactive fictions of today, such as hypertext literature, adventure games, and visual novels. From there, students will embark on their own adventure through interactive creative writing. The journey will begin with students taking apart and diagraming existing interactive works, and using digital tools to craft and share their own short interactive scenes and dialogs. We will confront the challenges and limitations of writing interactive story and establish some key critical theories governing non-linearity. The course will culminate in students designing and writing a complete short work of interactive fiction in a medium of their choice. \n",

      "Students in the LAB class are asked to immerse themselves into design thinking and research, with the goal of understanding the many interlocking issues that emerge with any urban design proposal. The aim of this LAB is to produce a set of new ideas, action items, physical improvements, and ultimately, design proposals to enhance the quality of life in our city. The LAB is will focus on the many systems that structure urban life in New York City. Whether we look at familiar systems, such as transportation, food, waste management or other less, evident systems, such as zoning, water, electricity, or telecommunications, the class will take as its challenge an understanding of all these as “designed” systems that can be affected by strategic interventions. While traditional urban design might focus first on streets and buildings and the spaces between them, the limitation of this established pedagogy its failure to address the many interdisciplinary overlaps that occur in designing and occupying a city. The LAB will engage a wide range of formal and analytical assumptions that underpin the development of existing systems, even as we speculate on new propositions to restructure current socio-ecological frameworks. Introductory design, reading, and writing exercises prepare students for an intense focus on a pressing urban problem, resulting in a final all-class design project that will be presented to the public as part of NYCxDESIGN week. Authors may include Ian McHarg (Design with Nature); Kate Ascher (The Works: Anatomy of a City); William McDonough and Michael Braungart (Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things); Geoff Manaugh (The Bldg Blog Book); David Harvey (The Right to the City); Neil Smith (Uneven Development: Nature, Capital, and the Production of Space); among others.\n",

      "For ancient Rome, the shift from republic to empire meant the unprecedented centralization of power within a single figure. This course explores the rise and reign of Rome’s most remembered autocrats, Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, analyzing the birth of the Roman empire from both contemporary and current perspectives. How did Caesar disrupt the traditional dynamics of Roman society? How did the rise of Augustus complicate Roman paradigms of power? And what can these ancient autocrats teach us about leadership and authority in the modern world? Together we examine these questions in context, including the notion of the Pax Romana and Pax Americana, considering also the relationship between power, state, and people within various facets of ancient and modern society. We will utilize both primary texts in translation and secondary sources on the reception of Caesarian politics and the ethics of empire. Readings include Vergil, Ovid, Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt, Duncan Kennedy, and Clifford Ando. A series of short writing assignments will prepare students to explore their historical or theoretical interests in a longer research paper. \n",

      "A blindfolded woman holding scales aloft: the classic allegory of Justice might suggest that justice is an abstraction. It also represents justice as tied to a state of equilibrium, which can be completely restored. Yet justice itself is very difficult to define, shifting its meanings over time, between cultures and among individuals; can we presume such a balance? Is justice really only an effect of power, the right of the strong to define the terms under which the weak live? How are law and justice connected? While these seem to be questions for political philosophers, they have also been addressed by literary writers. In this course, our focus will be on how literary texts take up these problems at different junctures primarily in the Western tradition. We will also read some jurists and critical theorists on what constitutes justice—and for whom. Readings may include Plato, Aeschylus, Herman Melville, Bertolt Brecht, Richard Wright, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Martha Nussbaum, and Nadine Gordimer. Assignments will include a variety of forms of writing, including a research essay in which students will seek to integrate their thinking with that of our authors.\n",
      "Oral history is a complex process in the creation of artistic projects across the disciplines: documentary film, theatre, book arts, exhibitions, interactive websites, public radio, etc. This course offers training in interviewing and editing techniques, and looks at the ethics and impact of “truth-telling” on the people we interview, their families and friends, ourselves and the culture at large. Research explores the ways artistic projects informed by oral history have impacted popular culture. Readings, listening to public radio documentaries, and viewing films will be used to address the balance in accurately reflecting the realities and integrity of the people represented while staying true to the vision of the artist. Readings include (but are not limited to): Art Spiegelman’s  <em>Maus I & II</em> ; works by Studs Terkel including  <em>Working</em> ; Greg Halpern’s  <em>Harvard Works Because We Do</em> , listening to audio and reading slave narratives from  <em>Remembering Slavery</em>  project, Smithsonian;  <em>Crossing the BLVD</em> , Lehrer/Sloan; Anna Deveare Smith, and Dave Isay. For final projects students create collaborative or solo work in the discipline of their own training; theatre, artist books, dance/movement, photography, poetry, music, radio, audio art, film or video. \n",

      "From “Casablanca\" and \"A Clockwork Orange” to “ Sophie’s Choice” and “Planet of the Apes,\" popular films offer surprisingly perceptive insights into complex philosophical concepts. This course begins by using \"Pulp Fiction\" to explore the nature of philosophical thought experiments. It will then draw on a wide range of films – along with a diverse selection of historical and contemporary thinkers – in order to explore many of the central areas of philosophy. We will consider perception (the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual data, in particular how they relate to beliefs about, or knowledge of, the world), philosophy of mind (the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, and their relationship to the physical body), and determinism (the philosophical idea that every event or state of affairs, including every human decision and action, is the inevitable and necessary consequence of antecedent states of affairs). Debates around ethics, religion, free will, and the nature of time will also enter our discussions. Readings will be drawn from Aristotle, Anselm, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Locke, Nagel, Pascal, Putnam, and Williams, among others.\n",

We will spend the second half of the semester drafting, workshopping, revising, presenting, and completing your colloquium rationale and booklist.

They will decode words as sounds, underscore poems and stories, use improvisation structures in games to generate musical and/or lyric material, and work with collage recording influenced by sampler use. Through collaborative processes, students will use their unified text/music language to create a full length performance or recording. Each student will produce either a complete (20 minutes or more) performance, record an EP, create an installation piece that involves text and music, or develop a new mixed form. New source material will come from in-class writing prompts and various improvisation games. Readings by or about modern performers including Meredith Monk, John Zorn, Kendrick Lamar and Laurie Anderson will provide models for various strategies. We will also engage with books about the recording process from the 331/3 series. Theoretical investigations will include works by Rita Aiello, Steven Pinker, Jenefer Robinson, John Cage, and Theodor Adorno. It is suggested that students have completed ARTS-UG 1340.\n",

Can words (and, for that matter, music and images) save lives and give form to terrifying uncertainty? This course will explore the literary and aesthetic methodologies used to represent traumatic events and historical crises. By focusing on autobiographical and documentary accounts of three types of dramatic experiences in twentieth-century history (privations and displacement during the October Revolution, hunger during the Leningrad Blockade, and mass incarceration during the Holocaust and Stalinist repressions), we will analyze the international intellectual context that their authors engage with and the ways in which their narratives are structured to impart form to chaos. For their research paper, students will be invited to apply concepts derived from historical readings to analyze an approved work of their choice, emblematic of emergency literature (past or contemporary), and its context. Readings may include: René Descartes, Walter Benjamin, Leo Tolstoy, Victor Shklovsky, Lydia Ginzburg, Varlam Shalamov, Giorgio Agamben, Primo Levi, W.G. Sebald, James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coates.

      "According to the philosopher Peter A.

What are the opportunities and challenges to establishing a common moral framework for addressing bioethical concerns worldwide? Are cultural and geographic variations of ethical concerns and means for addressing them inevitable and perhaps appropriate? We will explore the historical context, principles and practices of bioethics and global health, as well as their interrelationships. Other issues that we will discuss in this seminar include the social determinants of health, human rights, research ethics, HIV/AIDS, ethical issues at the end of life, and emergency/disaster relief. Throughout the course we will utilize case studies to compare and contrast bioethical dilemmas locally, nationally and internationally. Students will learn and apply a stepwise approach for conducting ethical analysis. Class activities will include simulated clinical bioethics committees, research ethics review committees as well as policy analysis and recommendations. Course readings will include scholarly articles and chapters from the medical and social science literature such as public health, political science and philosophy. Additionally, we will read from selected works of fiction that can inform and enrich our discussion of global bioethics including Camus’  <em>The Plague</em>  and Conrad’s  <em>The Heart of Darkness</em> .\n",

Using the lens of comparative racial formation, this seminar investigates Asian American political participation around contemporary issues such as immigration, multiracial coalitions, affirmative action, data disaggregation, detention and deportation, Islamophobia, intergenerational relations, and gentrification. This course will explore the political developments that gave rise to “Asian America” in the 1960s and probe deeper theoretical questions about the complexities and pluralities of the contemporary Asian American experience. We will also consider the role of American political institutions including the federal, state, and local governments, and how public policies at all levels come to shape the political lives of Asian Americans in the United States. Texts include Claire Jean Kim’s Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City, Karen Ishizuka’s Serve the People: Making Asian America in the Long Sixties, Eric Tang’s Unsettled: Cambodian Refugees in the New York City Hyperghetto, and Monisha Das Gupta’s Unruly Immigrants: Rights, Activism, and Transnational South Asian Politics in the United States.

      "This workshop is dedicated to the oft-repeated observation that all writing is re-writing. Each writer focuses their efforts on only one or two short stories, rather than starting many new stories and abandoning them in favor of yet another new beginning. Students take each of their stories through a number of drafts and revise them in response to (though not necessarily in accord with) questions and comments raised by other members of the workshop. The objective is to learn ways of staying with such challenges as maintaining the story's voice, determining the order of experience, and arriving at an ending that satisfies the design of the story as well as the intentions of the writer. Workshop members share their stories in class throughout the semester and comment in detail on one another's work. Participants should have some experience writing short stories. \n",

How do writers bring a personal voice to writing a political essay? And how do reporters balance opinion and research to show the need for change? These questions are considered as you write 1) an essay centered on an issue that you care about, and 2) a report that you write from observation about a social or political movement. Finally, writing an argument or advocacy piece on a public debate allows you to incorporate many of the lessons from the semester. Revision is part of our process, guided by peer reviews.\n",

      "In an independent study, students work one-on-one with a faculty member on a particular topic or creative project. Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the professor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing. Independent studies are graded courses, the details of which are formulated by the student and his or her instructor; these specifics are described in the Independent Study proposal and submitted to the Gallatin School for approval. The student and instructor meet regularly throughout the semester to discuss the readings, the research, and the student's work. Credit is determined by the amount of work entailed in the study and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Generally, independent studies, like other courses, are 2 to 4 credits. Meeting hours correspond to course credits; a 4-credit independent study requires at least seven contact hours per term between the teacher and the student.\n",
      "The image of the medieval world as dark, backward, and stagnant has for too long held sway over our modern popular conceptions of the era. In this course, we will investigate the ways in which the Middle Ages were actually a period of vast movement, migration, and pilgrimage. We will study the “discovery” of North America by Scandinavian sailors five centuries before Columbus. We will explore the colonization of the New World by European powers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. And throughout, we will ask how we can better understand the history of identity formation, orientalism, and imperialism in the pre-modern era. We will delve into the questions, the conflicts, and the painful changes that these travels and encounters fomented both within European society and without. Readings may include the  <em>Confession of St. Patrick</em> , Bede’s  <em>Ecclesiastical History of the English People</em> ,  <em>The Thousand and One Nights</em> , the  <em>Saga of Eirik the Red</em> , Marco Polo’s  <em>Division of the World</em> , Mandeville’s  <em>Travels</em> , Dante’s  <em>Divine Comedy</em> , Chaucer’s  <em>Canterbury Tales</em> , Christine de Pizan’s <em> Book of the City of Ladies</em> , More’s  <em>Utopia</em> , Bartolomé de las Casas’  <em>Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies</em> , and Françoise de Graffigny’s  <em>Letters from a Peruvian Woman</em> .\n",

      "From Jeffrey Eugenides's novel  <em>The Marriage Plot</em>  to TV's  <em>Desperate Housewives</em>  and \"Real Housewives\" series, our contemporary culture explores what happens after \"happily ever after.\" Some of the great novels of the mid-to-late 19th century also examine the dilemmas of wives during a period when every aspect of \"The Woman Question,\" including divorce and child custody laws, was debated. In this course we explore controversial novels in which female characters struggle with lives largely limited by the cultural stereotypes of the Angel in the House and the emerging New Woman. Readings include Gustave Flaubert’s  <em>Madame Bovary</em>  (1856), Kate Chopin's  <em>The Awakening</em>  (1899), and George Gissing’s  <em>The Odd Women</em>  (1893). We contextualize each with readings on historical events in the French, American, and English settings. We also read about the post-publication history of these works, including Flaubert’s trial for obscenity, Chopin’s supposedly abandoning novel-writing because of the controversy over her work, and Gissing’s own two disastrous marriages. Other readings include selections from J.S. Mill's  <em>The Subjection of Women</em>  and from the theory of Thorstein Veblen and Michel Foucault.\n",

      "“Good writing,” Joy Williams argues, “startles the reader back into Life.” Keeping that core criterion in mind, this introductory workshop course will ask students to steep themselves in the immersive disciplines of writing and critiquing original works of fiction. We’ll carefully explore and interrogate traditional ideas of plot, structure, characterization, and dialogue, but we’ll also place special emphasis on the architecture of the sentence itself: all the little syntactical, acoustic and lexical choices that allow certain lines of prose to feel so uncannily clear and jarring and permanent. How do we use words to get at what Virginia Woolf called “the original jar of the object on the nerves?” The course will operate from the premise that one of the best ways to become a better writer is to become a more conscientious, promiscuous and creatively critical reader of other people’s work. In that spirit, we’ll supplement our weekly workshops by reading and discussing exemplary works of fiction from a diverse array of writers including Joy Williams, Cormac McCarthy, Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Denis Johnson, Flannery O' Connor, Jenny Erpenbeck, and Don DeLillo, among others . Students will also be given short writing prompts that allow them to experiment with the formal strategies they encounter in those texts.\n",

We will survey this history by considering the evolving idea of ‘the world’ itself, from Enlightenment articulations to studies of the world economy to crucial 20th century and contemporary interventions, tracing the shifting meanings of 'the world’ in relation to contemporaneous works that have been seen as representative of 'World Literature.’ In the last third of the semester we will read and discuss recent novels and critical studies engaged with modern understandings of the term 'World Literature.’ Fictional texts will include works by Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Nadine Gordimer, Franz Kafka, Arundhati Roy, and Zadie Smith. Theoretical texts will include Goethe’s writings on “Weltliteratur,” Kant’s  <em>Political Writings</em> , Hegel’s  <em>Introduction to the Philosophy of History</em> , selections from Marx’s  <em>Capital</em> , Fanon’s  <em>Black Skin, White Masks</em> , Heidegger's  <em>Poetry Language Thought</em> , Emily Apter’s  <em>Against World Literature</em> , and essays on World Literature by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, David Damrosch, Franco Moretti, Debjani Ganguly, and Pheng Cheah.\n",

And how do we write about it? This advanced writing course will survey the story of American comedy in all its multifarious formats—the sitcom, the film comedy, the stand-up act, the variety show— while also serving as a workshop for cultural criticism that goes deeper than the recap. Utilizing a combination of reading, viewing, live performances, and workshopping, this course will sharpen students’ skills as writers by exposing them to the wide range of American comedy from Charlie Chaplin to “Key & Peele,” with units on African-American comedy, women in comedy, political comedy, and self-aware comedy, among others. In this course, we will wrestle with the complexities of writing about comedy, including, but not limited to, the question of whether being funny about what’s funny is a faux pas or a necessity. Writing assignments will offer students the opportunity to learn about the craft of cultural criticism by attending a stand-up show and writing a review, writing about a work of comedy that makes you uncomfortable, and other prompts. Readings will include essays by Clive James, Emily Nussbaum, James Agee, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Wesley Morris, Roxane Gay, and others.\n",

      "“If you put on anarchist glasses,\" writes political scientist James C. Scott in his book Two Cheers for Anarchism, “and look at the history of popular movements, revolutions, ordinary politics and the state from that angle, certain insights will appear that are obscured from almost any other angle.” Using an “anarchist squint,” Scott argues, allows us to better understand more clearly informal order, submerged politics, informal regulation of markets and commons, resistance to the state, subversion of legal regimes, and other topics. In can show us, in other words, the ways that people have built order, regulated their lives, and resisted domination in ways outside and against the state. The idea of this seminar is to adopt such an “anarchist squint” and take anarchism as method for students’ varied work. We will spend the term reading scholarship about communities, property, the state, law, and power to test the utility of an “anarchist squint” for our own work. Authors may include Scott, Colin Ward, Patricia Erick and Susan Silby, Elinor Ostrom, David Graeber, and others. Familiarity or affinity with political anarchism are unnecessary but welcome.\n"
